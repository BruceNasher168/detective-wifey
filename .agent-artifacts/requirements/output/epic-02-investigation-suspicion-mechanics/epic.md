# Epic 02: Clue Inspection, Puzzle Unlocks, Hints & Suspicion Engine

## Summary

The Clue Inspection, Puzzle Unlocks, Hints & Suspicion Engine establishes the interactive detective mechanics for *Bắt được Tiểu tam* (Jealous Wife Detective Game). It empowers players to inspect and collect evidence without giveaway UI tells, solve polymorphic security challenges (4-digit PIN pads and security questions on Levels 2 and 3), navigate husband suspicion escalation and lockout delays, recover from caught-snooping fail states, and trigger the "Giác Quan Thứ 6" (Sixth Sense) app-badging hint engine when stuck.

## Business Value

- Delivers the core tactile detective mechanics (zero-spoiler long-press pinning) that empower players to actively curate evidence rather than passively read text.
- Introduces progressive puzzle friction (PIN pads and security questions) on Levels 2 and 3 to reward cross-app clue deduction.
- Implements dynamic tension through escalating suspicion strikes and skippable lockout delays, culminating in a comedic "Bị giật lại máy" fail state.
- Provides a frictionless hint mechanism ("Giác Quan Thứ 6") to prevent player drop-off without giving away immediate answers.

## High-Level Requirements

- Universal 380ms hold on story narrative opens `UniversalEvidenceModal` with one pin-to-notebook action. Structural chrome is excluded. This follows the signed-off 2026-10-20 pinning rules rather than the older dual-action sheet.
- Decoy/Noise Tolerance: Pinning action available on all items (including benign clutter) with zero visual highlights or UI spoiler tells prior to interaction.
- Polymorphic App Lock Decorator Component supporting 4-digit numeric PIN pads and text/select security questions for locked apps/folders on Levels 2 and 3.
- Suspicion Strike Engine tracking failed unlock attempts against level-specific limits (Level 1: 5 strikes, Level 2: 4 strikes, Level 3: 3 strikes) with skippable ~60s lockout timer animation.
- "Bị giật lại máy" Caught-Snooping Fail Screen triggered upon exceeding strike thresholds, featuring comedic roast dialogue and immediate level retry routing.
- "Giác Quan Thứ 6" (Sixth Sense) trigger inside the notebook resolves the next uncollected clue and badges/pulses its home screen app icon. When all required clues are collected, provide a general notebook reminder without revealing the correct connection.
- Level 0 coaching guides the first inspection, long-press and pin actions using existing app surfaces. It does not distinguish true clues from decoys or create permanent pin buttons.
- Dynamic Island status toast notifications confirming evidence/suspect pinning events without obstructing gameplay.

## Business Outcome

Players experience engaging, high-stakes snooping gameplay with zero giveaway spoilers. The difficulty naturally scales across levels through lock challenges and tightening suspicion thresholds, while hint mechanics guarantee casual players never get permanently stuck.

## Business Rules

- **Zero-Spoiler Uniformity**: No visual affordances (glowing borders, badges, or custom cursors) may reveal which items are valid clues prior to user interaction.
- **Level-Based Suspicion Limits**: Level 1 permits 5 strikes; Level 2 permits 4 strikes; Level 3 permits 3 strikes.
- **Lockout Timing**: Failed unlock attempts trigger a 60-second lockout timer, which casual players may skip to maintain engagement.
- **Non-Punitive Fail State**: Case fail state ("Bị giật lại máy") permits instant, zero-penalty retry of the active case.
- **Hint Cooldown**: "Giác Quan Thứ 6" is free with a 30-second cooldown in every level, including Level 0.
- **Level 0 Safe Practice**: Explain mistakes and allow retries without losing the tutorial case. Normal-case suspicion rules remain applicable outside Level 0.
