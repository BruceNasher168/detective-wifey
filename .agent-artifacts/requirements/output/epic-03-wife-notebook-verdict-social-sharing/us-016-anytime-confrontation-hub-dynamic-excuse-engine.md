# US-016 - Anytime Confrontation Hub & Dynamic Excuse Engine ("Đối chất & Chối bay chối biến")

### Epic: [Epic 03](./epic.md)

As a Player (Wife), I want to initiate confrontation ("Đối chất") with the husband at any time to test my evidence, listen to comedic excuses, and convict him for a 1–3 star victory.

### Canonical Wireframe Reference

- [ASCII Wireframe - Screen SSOT](./wireframes/wireframe-us-016-confrontation-hub.md)
- [Corkboard Canvas Wireframe Reference](./wireframes/wireframe-us-015-corkboard-node-canvas.md)
- Interactive HTML: pending ASCII signoff; not generated.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Tapping the "Đối chất" action button from the Wife's Detective Notebook top bar opens the Anytime Confrontation stage as a full-screen modal overlay (`z-index: 80`).
2. Opening confrontation automatically evaluates the player's active corkboard Knowledge Graph state (verified edges between clues, bridge identifiers, and unmasked suspects) against `caseConfig.groundTruth` without requiring manual card slotting or drag-and-drop submission.
3. Confronting with 0 verified smoking-gun links triggers the premature confrontation failure state:
   - The husband delivers dismissive gaslighting dialogue (e.g., Level 1: "Em lại lướt TikTok drama rồi đa nghi đúng không? Anh đi làm cả ngày mệt mỏi, em lại tra khảo anh chuyện vô căn cứ!").
   - The game increments the Suspicion Meter by 1 strike.
   - If the added strike reaches the case's strike limit (5 strikes in Level 1), the "Caught Snooping" fail state ("Bị giật lại máy", US-014) triggers immediately.
   - Otherwise, the screen displays a "Tiếp tục điều tra" button that closes confrontation and returns the player to the active view without penalty to case progression.
4. Confronting with 1 verified smoking-gun link yields a 1-star win (`★☆☆`):
   - The husband delivers a defensive stammering excuse (e.g., Level 1: "Số thợ điện hôm trước anh gọi nhờ sửa dây mạng văn phòng mà...").
   - Unlocks the "Tha thứ & Qua màn" progression action (US-018) while offering a "Điều tra tiếp để đạt 3 sao" button to return to the case.
5. Confronting with 2 verified smoking-gun links yields a 2-star win (`★★☆`):
   - The husband delivers a stammering partial explanation (e.g., Level 1: "Con bé Marketing nhờ anh đặt hộ để áp mã Freeship Extra thôi mà em!").
   - Unlocks the "Tha thứ & Qua màn" progression action while offering a "Điều tra tiếp để đạt 3 sao" button.
6. Confronting with 3 verified smoking-gun links (or the case's complete smoking-gun chain) yields a watertight 3-star victory (`★★★`):
   - The husband breaks down and confesses fully (e.g., Level 1: "Anh xin lỗi vợ... Thôi anh khai thật! Bọn anh có hẹn riêng tối nay ở quán cơm niêu... Em đừng giận nữa mà!").
   - Awards the case's custom Wife Title (e.g., "Nữ thám tử ghen tuông").
   - Displays the victory comedic roast narrative.
   - Displays the "Tạo thẻ Roast khoe MXH" button (US-017) and the "Tha thứ & Qua màn" button (US-018).
7. Accusing an innocent red-herring suspect with verified bridge edges triggers specific over-jealous roast punchlines tailored to that suspect's alibi before returning to investigation.
8. All confrontation evaluation, excuse branching, and star calculation execute 100% client-side without network calls or external server dependencies.

### Out of Scope

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| OOS01 | Manual drag-and-drop evidence slots inside the confrontation view |
| OOS02 | Voice acting, audio clips, or animated video cutscenes for husband reactions |
| OOS03 | Microtransactions or paid hints to bypass failed confrontation strikes |
| OOS04 | Cloud backend synchronization or server-side score validation |

### Non-functional Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Platform | Follow existing [global NFRs](../vision-scope.md#4-key-constraints--non-functional-requirements-global); no new backend service. |
| UI & Accessibility | High contrast text, dialog font size $\ge 16\text{px}$, minimum 44px × 44px touch targets, canonical Ionicons/vector SVGs (no raw emojis). |
| Performance | Graph evaluation and dialogue resolution complete in under 50ms upon tapping "Đối chất". |
| Data Consistency | Star rating and completion status persist strictly to local storage (`PlaySession.stars`). |

### Open Questions

None for confirmed behavior. ASCII signoff and team sizing remain pending; status stays draft.
