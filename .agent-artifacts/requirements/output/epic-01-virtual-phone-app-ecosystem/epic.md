# Epic 01: Virtual Phone Shell & MVP Parody App Suite (Release 1)

## Summary

The Virtual Phone Shell & MVP Parody App Suite establishes the central player interface for *Bắt được Tiểu tam* (Jealous Wife Detective Game) for **Release 1 (MVP)**. It emulates a modern Vietnamese husband's smartphone using an authentic iOS-inspired shell architecture, featuring a titanium bezel frame, Dynamic Island pill cutout, split iOS status bar, Level 1 dynamic home screen launcher (mounting the 4 active clue apps: Zola, VietPay, Poshee, Comms), dynamic notification toasts, in-app navigation headers, an iOS AssistiveTouch floating quick action menu, a Level Selector modal sheet, and pluggable micro-app integration contracts.

## Business Value

- Delivers the core immersive "phone snooping" experience central to the game's comedic premise.
- Limits active apps on Level 1 strictly to the 4 clue apps to eliminate cognitive overload and reading fatigue for casual players.
- Provides an omnipresent iOS AssistiveTouch floating menu allowing players to return home, inspect the Wife's Detective Notebook, select levels, or restart cases from any screen.
- Provides a scalable, decoupled architecture (`AppDefinition`, `CaseConfig`, `LevelCatalog`) allowing future micro-apps and detective cases to be added via declarative data schemas without modifying the UI engine.

## High-Level Requirements

- Outer mobile frame container rendering realistic iOS smartphone ergonomics (393px × 852px viewport base, centered desktop frame).
- Apple Dynamic Island pill cutout with split status bar displaying narrative clock (*23:45*) on the left and status indicators (cellular signal, *5G*, battery glyph *42%*) on the right.
- Level-based dynamic iOS launcher layout displaying the 4 active MVP clue apps for Level 1 (Zola, VietPay, Poshee, Comms dialer/SMS) across launcher grid and frosted glass dock.
- Omnipresent iOS AssistiveTouch floating button expanding a quick menu: Home (`🏠`), Wife's Notebook (`🎀`), Level Selector (`🗂️`), Case Restart (`🔄`), and Fullscreen (`⛶`).
- Mobile browser chrome suppression: PWA standalone capability (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `theme-color`), W3C Fullscreen API request on Android/desktop, iOS Safari Add-to-Home-Screen guidance sheet, and viewport scroll/rubber-band lock (`overscroll-behavior: none`).
- Level Selector modal sheet displaying progressive case levels, earned star ratings (1 to 3 stars), and locked gating validation.
- Sub-100ms client-side screen switching between home screen launcher and mounted app views.
- Declarative case configuration schema engine statically bundled for zero runtime server dependencies.

## Business Outcome

Players experience a fluid, culturally authentic smartphone simulation where snooping feels natural and high-stakes. Game designers can deploy new cases and levels entirely through declarative TypeScript schemas.

## Business Rules

- **Level-Based App Launcher Provisioning**: The home screen launcher dynamically mounts only the active apps configured for that level (Level 1 mounts 4 active apps: Zola, VietPay, Poshee, Comms) to eliminate text fatigue and cognitive overload for early players.
- **Client-Side Latency SLA**: App switching and navigation transitions must complete in < 100ms with zero network round-trips.
- **100% Client-Side Privacy**: Zero server calls, zero telemetry, and zero cookie persistence.

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: Signed-off elicitation session ([`2026-10-13-jealous-wife-detective-game.md`](../elicitation/2026-10-13-jealous-wife-detective-game.md)), Vision & Scope ([`vision-scope.md`](../vision-scope.md)), Functional Decomposition ([`functional-decomposition.md`](../functional-decomposition.md)).
- **Downstream**: Clue inspection & suspicion engine (Epic 02), Wife's notebook & verdict hub (Epic 03), Husband Hoàng Level 1 MVP Case (Epic 04).
