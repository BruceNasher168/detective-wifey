# Develop Virtual App

> **Current runtime ownership and imports**: [runtime code ownership](../../../.agent-artifacts/project-knowledge-base/solution-context/architecture/runtime-code-ownership.md). App-specific components stay inside their app; evidence UI is consumed through `src/features/investigation/index.ts`. Use runtime TypeScript contracts for current signatures.

- Implements modular, client-side virtual applications mounted on the emulated smartphone container for the *Jealous Wife Detective Game*.
- Enforces strict adherence to individual `app-design.md` branding tokens, touch target ergonomics ($\ge 44 \times 44\text{px}$), the `AppDefinition` registry contract, and declarative clue wiring.

## Prerequisites & Inputs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Stop & Ask on Ambiguity**: If the target `appId`, clue schema, or UI design specification is ambiguous: **STOP IMMEDIATELY**. Ask the user for clarification with structured options (2–4 per turn) and a recommendation.

- **Target App ID**: One of `zola`, `vietpay`, `poshee`, `grap`, `netsurf`, `photos`, `comms`, `husband_notes`.
- **Design & Component SSOT**: Target app's canonical `app-design.md` and shared primitives under `src/shared/ui/`, `src/shell/`. Always reuse existing assets first.
- **Clue Mapping**: Target clue IDs verified against [clue-traceability-matrix.md](../../../.agent-artifacts/requirements/stories/clues/clue-traceability-matrix.md) or `caseData.appsData`.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Design & Specification Intake (Mandatory App Design & Reuse Gate)
1. Read the target app's `app-design.md` file using `view_file`. Extract:
   - Primary and secondary brand color hex codes.
   - Parody identity and trademark defense guidelines (e.g. avoid real-world app blue/green palettes).
   - Canonical icon pack mapping from `apps/phone-os/app-design.md` Section 2.4 (Ionicons (react-icons/io5)). Strictly enforce zero Unicode emojis.
   - Touch target dimensions ($\ge 44 \times 44\text{px}$) and row height constraints.
   - Screen hierarchy and layout wireframes.
2. Read the app's `features.md` to identify forensic capabilities (e.g. chat search, hidden albums, ride history).
3. Audit `src/shared/ui/` to map existing shared components against the app-design layout wireframes. Never create new components if an existing primitive can be reused or extended.
4. When inspecting wireframes, extract strictly the inner micro-app view hierarchy conforming to the Pure OS invariant in [frontend-game-developer.md](../../agents/frontend-game-developer.md); discard documentation scaffolding and simulated browser chrome.

### Step 2: Component Scaffolding & Registry Setup
1. Instantiate [assets/app-component.template.tsx](assets/app-component.template.tsx) into `src/apps/<appId>/<AppName>App.tsx`.
2. Configure the `AppDefinition` export in `src/apps/<appId>/index.ts`:
   - `appId`: Strict literal matching `AppId`.
   - `displayName`: Parody app name from `app-design.md`.
   - `themeColor`: Brand hex code.
   - `iconAsset`: Path to optimized SVG icon or canonical Ionicons icon identifier (strictly zero Unicode emojis).
   - `component`: The React component.
3. Register the new app export in `src/bootstrap/appRegistry.ts`.

### Step 3: Implement Forensics, Interactivity & Navigation
1. Implement the header with a back button (`min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]`) invoking `onReturnHome` or returning to the top list view.
2. Implement feed/list and detail/inspection views.
3. Ensure all list rows and tap targets satisfy $\ge 44 \times 44\text{px}$ minimum clickable bounds.
4. Wire universal **Swipe Right to Go Back** via `useSwipeBack` (`src/shared/gestures/useSwipeBack.ts`) or `SwipeBackContainer` (`src/shared/ui/SwipeBackContainer.tsx`): detail views must pop back to list view with `e.stopPropagation()`, and root views must navigate to `onReturnHome()`.

### Step 4: Wire Suspect Tagging & Declarative Clues (Universal Long-Press Invariant)
1. **Story Narrative Data Only**:
   - Wrap legitimate story narrative elements loaded dynamically from `caseData.appsData?.[appId]` (chat bubbles, call records, SMS texts, bank transaction memos, order receipts, notes, private photos) in `<StoryEvidenceTarget item={{ title, subtitle, snippet, suspectToTag }} onTriggerEvidence={setEvidenceItem}>`.
   - On 380ms long-press, mount `<UniversalEvidenceModal>` providing a blurred snapshot preview and a confirmation button to pin into the Wife's Notebook via `onTagSuspect(suspectName, appId)`.
2. **Prohibition on App Chrome & Structural Elements**:
   - Never wrap navigation headers, back buttons, tabs, search inputs, contact action rows ("Cloud của tôi", "Lời mời kết bạn"), or settings buttons in `StoryEvidenceTarget`. They must respond exclusively to standard clicks/taps with zero evidence overlays.
3. **Strict Zero-Button Pin Invariant**:
   - Permanent "Ghim" or physical Pin buttons (`<button>.*Ghim.*</button>`) are strictly forbidden across all app screens, feeds, and modals. Clues can ONLY be pinned via the long-press modal.
4. **Declarative Ingestion & Benign Filler**:
   - Consume dynamic case data exclusively from `caseData.appsData?.[appId]`.
   - If no clues are present for this app in the current case, render realistic benign filler content (parody memes, spam notifications, family chats) to prevent process-of-elimination spoilers.

### Step 5: Verification & Contract Audit Gate
For story-data changes, apply the [story implementation review](../level-designer/references/story-first-design.md#5-đọc-duyệt-khi-triển-khai-hoặc-sửa-dữ-liệu-truyện) as part of this gate.

Execute the following verification commands in order. All checks must pass with zero errors before reporting completion:
1. Run the companion design and contract verification script:
   ```bash
   python .agents/skills/develop-virtual-app/scripts/validate_app_design.py --app-id <appId> --component src/apps/<appId>/<AppName>App.tsx
   ```
2. Verify TypeScript strict compilation (catches invalid icon imports and JSX syntax errors):
   ```bash
   npx tsc -b
   ```
3. Run the automated test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. Verify production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Inspect touch targets ($\ge 44 \times 44\text{px}$) and transition latency ($< 100\text{ms}$).

## Conditional Branching & Fallbacks

- **Branch: If App or Folder is Locked (`lockChallengeId`)**:
  - Check if `unlockedChallenges.has(challengeId)`.
  - If locked, render the polymorphic lock interceptor overlay (4-digit numeric PIN pad or security question challenge) or invoke `onRequestUnlock(challengeId)`.
  - Dispatch failed attempts to the global Suspicion Engine.
- **Branch: If Declarative Data is Empty for Current Level**:
  - Render benign, realistic parody filler. Never crash with `undefined` property errors.
- **Error: If Contract Validation Fails**:
  - Inspect output of `validate_app_design.py`. Fix missing handlers (`onReturnHome`, `onTagSuspect`) or unaligned color tokens before proceeding.

## Deliverables & Consumer Soundness

- **Primary Consumer**: TypeScript compiler, Vite bundler, React runtime.
- **Artifacts**:
  - `src/apps/<appId>/<AppName>App.tsx` (Component implementation).
  - `src/apps/<appId>/index.ts` (Exporting `AppDefinition`).
  - `src/bootstrap/appRegistry.ts` (Universal 8-app registry entry).
- **Quality Gates**:
  - 100% compliant with colors and wireframes in `app-design.md`.
  - Zero hardcoded clue narratives.
  - Strict TypeScript compliance (zero `any`, full type safety across `VirtualAppProps`).
  - SOLID modularity: Subcomponents separated by responsibility (Header, List, Detail, LockGate).
  - Passes `validate_app_design.py` with zero contract errors.

## Anti-Patterns & Negative Constraints

- **Never bypass `app-design.md`**: Do not invent arbitrary color schemes, fonts, or layouts without checking the authoritative `app-design.md` first.
- **Never hardcode clues or suspect names**: Clue data must come from declarative `caseData` schemas.
- **Never mutate the home screen shell directly**: Pluggable apps must remain strictly decoupled and mount via the registry.
- **Never omit touch targets**: Every interactive button, list row, or tab must have minimum dimensions of $44 \times 44\text{px}$.
- **Never make network calls**: Virtual apps execute 100% client-side; never invoke `fetch()` or external APIs.
- **Never use `any` types or bypass prop validation**: Strongly type all internal component state and props.
- **Never write monolithic single-file apps**: Decompose apps into subcomponents with clear single responsibilities.
- **Never create redundant UI primitives**: If a header, back button, modal sheet, lock pad, or suspect tag button already exists in `src/shared/ui/`, you MUST reuse or compose it instead of writing a duplicate version inside the app.
- **Never use raw Unicode emojis for UI icons or buttons**: Strictly render vector SVG icons from the canonical icon pack (**Ionicons** (`react-icons/io5`)) defined in `phone-os/app-design.md`.
- **Never port wireframe documentation chrome or wrap apps in fake chassis frames**: Micro-apps mount directly within the Pure OS viewport defined in [frontend-game-developer.md](../../agents/frontend-game-developer.md); never copy multi-view comparison headers, simulated browser toolbars, or outer hardware casings.
